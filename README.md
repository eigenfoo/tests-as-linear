A Python port of Jonas Kristoffer Lindel√∏v's post [_Common statistical tests are
linear models (or: how to teach
stats)_](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/), which originally had
accompanying code in R.

## Notes on Python port

The original post used R's built-in functions to verify that the linear models
were indeed equivalent to the statistical tests (by showing that the p-values,
t-values, and other such statistics, were the same in either case). In this
Python port, we instead verify that `scipy.stats` functions and `smf.ols` output
agree.

The original R post had [four
appendices](https://github.com/lindeloev/tests-as-linear/tree/master/simulations),
each of which demonstrated (through numerical simulation) that a common
statistical test was well-approximated by a linear model. These simulations have
not been ported to Python (yet!). This is [an outstanding
issue](https://github.com/eigenfoo/tests-as-linear/issues/14). In the meantime,
please refer to the [original appendices
upstream](https://github.com/lindeloev/tests-as-linear/tree/master/simulations)
for the simulations.
