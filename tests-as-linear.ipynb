    "Most of the common statistical models (t-test, correlation, ANOVA; chi-square, etc.) are special cases of linear models or a very close approximation. This beautiful simplicity means that there is less to learn. In particular, it all comes down to $y = a \\cdot x + b$ which most students know from highschool. Unfortunately, stats intro courses are usually taught as if each test is an independent tool, needlessly making life more complicated for students and teachers alike. \n",
    "\n",
    "This needless complexity multiplies when students try to rote learn the parametric assumptions underlying each test separately rather than deducing them from the linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, I think that teaching linear models first and foremost and *then* name-dropping the special cases along the way makes for an excellent teaching strategy, emphasizing *understanding* over rote learning. Since linear models are the same across frequentist, Bayesian, and permutation-based inferences, I'd argue that it's better to start with modeling than p-values, type-1 errors, Bayes factors, or other inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the teaching of *\"non-parametric\"* tests in intro-courses, I think that we can justify [lying-to-children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children) and teach \"non-parametric\"\" tests as if they are merely ranked versions of the corresponding parametric tests. It is much better for students to think \"ranks!\" than to believe that you can magically throw away assumptions. Indeed, the Bayesian equivalents of \"non-parametric\"\" tests implemented in [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org) [literally just do (latent) ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06941) and that's it. For the frequentist \"non-parametric\"\" tests considered here, this approach is highly accurate for N > 15.\n",

I hope that you will join in suggesting improvements or submitting improvements yourself in [the Github repo to this page](https://github.com/lindeloev/tests-as-linear). Let's make it awesome!"
